Calculate the total net income (assuming various different interest rates) for each of the 100 scenarios given.

#### Task

I was given forecast inputs for 100 different scenarios.  Each scenario has 9 separate forecast inputs.

My task is to calculate the total net income (assuming various different interest rates) for each of the 100 scenarios given.  The interest rates that I’ll assume are 2%, 4%, 6% and 8%.

I will be calculating total net income at each interest rate listed above, for each of the 100 scenarios.  That means in total, I’ll have 100 x 4 = 400 different total net income calculations to do.

#### Results
I used the previously built income statment tool to perform the calculations and wrote a VBA macro to populate the output.

The output displays the total net income calculations to the right of the corresponding data for that scenario. Column A through Column J have the forecast inputs and to the right of these columns is the calculated total net income values, with a column for each interest rate.

The total net income for any scenario, is the sum of the net incomes for all years from 2021 – 2025.
