# Actuarial-Excel-Project-6-Net-Income-Projections-
Calculate the total net income (assuming various different interest rates) for each of the 100 scenarios given.

#### Task

In the data file above, you are given forecast inputs for 100 different scenarios.  Each scenario has 9 separate forecast inputs.

Your task is to calculate the total net income (assuming various different interest rates) for each of the 100 scenarios given.  The interest rates that you’ll assume are 2%, 4%, 6% and 8%.

You will be calculating total net income at each interest rate listed above, for each of the 100 scenarios.  That means in total, you’ll have 100 x 4 = 400 different total net income calculations to do.

You should do this using the tool that you created in Project # 5 and also by using VBA programming.

Your final workbook (aka your output) should display the total net income calculations to the right of the corresponding data for that scenario. So, you’ll have Column A through Column J with the forecast inputs and to the right of these columns you will place your calculated total net income values.

You will need to create 4 new columns to the right of the data to place your total net income calculations in, for each interest rate.

How to Calculate Total Net Income
To calculate total net income for any scenario, add up the net incomes for all years from 2021 – 2025.
